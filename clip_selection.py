    Two things were wrong with the old ``range(0, n, batch_size)`` walk plus a

    The cap made the shortlist unreachable. Its real ceiling was
    ``3 * n_batches``, not ``shortlist_target``: measured 22-sep-2026 on a
    9:10 source, 9 windows batched 8 + 1 returned 3 + 1 = 4 windows against a
    target of 8. ``clip_count_targets`` then derives the clip floor from that
    halved shortlist, so the detail pass was asked for 4-8 clips instead of
    6-12 and the job delivered 4 (3 in prod on the same video). Every source
    under ~30 minutes was starved the same way, which is the mechanism behind
    "95% of jobs deliver 3 clips or fewer" — the clip count the retention
    curve hangs on (see clip_count_targets). The prompt now scores every
    window it is given and the shortlist is the global top ``target``, so the
    selection happens where the scores can actually be compared.

    Per-batch selection also threw away the ranking it was computing: a batch
    holding five great moments could only contribute three, while a batch of
    filler still contributed its own three.

    The remainder was its own bug: a trailing batch of one window came back
    with that window whatever its score, because a cap of 3 cannot filter a
    batch of 1 — the tail of the video entered the shortlist by arithmetic
    rather than merit (``window_009`` did exactly that on the measured run).
    Near-equal batches keep that from happening and also keep each score
    comparable, since a window judged alone is judged against nothing.

    generous the model is, the more of the video disappears.

    That sabotages the windowing: get_viral_clips builds scoring windows

    near the start", and a positional slice puts the clustering right back.
